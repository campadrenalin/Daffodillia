# Daffodillia

Click and drag to grow your daffodils. They never actually stop growing, but they grow slower over time.

## Why?

Because my wife loves daffodils, and I love my wife, so I made this for her for her birthday.

## Your code is crap!

I wrote it in a hurry. Shipping on my wife's birthday was the most important feature. If you care enough, submit a PR improving it, but I suspect I'm calling your bluff.
